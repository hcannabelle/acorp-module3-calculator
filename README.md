### Calculator

This is the calculator project for Module 3 by Annabelle Corp.

## Logic

- When a button is pressed, add it to an array of keys
- When the equals button is pressed, iterate over the keys and try to solve the math that a person has entered

## Use case

We want to add 500 and 100. Steps are:

1. Click `5`, `0`, and `0`. The display should have `500` as its value.
2. Click plus `+`. The display should have `500 +` as its value.
3. Click `1`,`0`,`0`. The display should have `500 + 100` as its value.
4. Click equals `=`. Expression should be solved. The display should have `500 + 100 = 600`.
